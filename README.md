# ✅ To‑Do List CLI (Python)

A simple terminal‑based To‑Do List application built with Python.  
You can add, mark as done, delete tasks, and save your list between sessions.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Add a mission/task with a priority tag (HIGH / MIDLL / LOW).  
- List all missions, and mark any as done.  
- Delete a single mission or clear the entire list.  
- Data persistence: tasks are saved to a `todolist.pkl` file using `pickle`.
